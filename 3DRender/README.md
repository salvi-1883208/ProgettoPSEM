# 3D Renderer

In this folder there are both the renderer executable and the source code.
<br> To render a DLA structure a `matrix.txt` file is needed.
<br> 
<br> To render the structure in a `matrix.txt` file, it is enough to have both the `matrix.txt` and the `render` executable in the same folder.
<br> Execute simply with `./render`, it will load the `matrix.txt` file in the same folder and render the structure in a new window.
<br> In the window it is possible to rotate the camera moving the mouse and pressing left click. It is also possible to zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.
<br>
<br> The structure is rendered as cubes. Each cube represents a point in the matrix. The border of the space of the simulation are shown, as blue lines.
